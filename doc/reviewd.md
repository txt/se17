# Review Ques 4

1. What one thing we should be expect in:
       - a poorly architectured system?
       - a well architectured  system?
2. Package switching network (PSN):
       - Define the components of a PSN
       - What other architecture was package switching designed to replace?
       - Why was an advantage of that other architecture?
       - What feature of PSN make it attractive as an alternate architeture?
3. Blackboard architecutures:
       - Define the components of a blackboard architecture;
       - For which projects are  blackboard architectures are ideal?  
4. Pipe and Fiter:
       - Describe the components of a pipe and filter architecture.
       -  Give an example of a commonly used system that makes extensive use
         of pipe and filter
       - Explain one advantage of pipe and filter
       - Explain one dsadvantage of pipe and filter
5. Layered architectures:
       - What is "LAMP" and why is it an example of a layered architecture>
       - Explain one advantage of a layered architecture.
       - Explain one dsadvantage of pipe and filter
       - What is "MEAN" and why is it sometimes called a "leaky layered" architecture?
       - Why is MEAN replacing LAMP in certain fast-paced organizations?
6. CRUD:
       - What is the CRUD pattern?
       - Give two example where CRUD pattern is used.  
7. In Windows
    machine if you open one folder in two different views, rename folder in
    one view automatically renames the other.
         - What type of architecture is this?  
         - Describe different components of this architecture with respect to the above example.
